# Overview

This is my online portfolio for CS 160.

## Sub heading

In this portfolio, I have 3 main links int he body of the page. The first big link is my Resume. I have worked to shape my resume towards becoming an elementary school teacher. The sencond link is to my data visualization I created for Zagster usage in Bend, OR. This data tracks bike-share usage throughout different hours of the day. The third link is to the Cleveland Browns team website. I am a life long Cleveland sports fan, and it was a fun feature for me to practice using on html. 

In the top part, there are links to email me directly to my school email, as well as view my GitHub page online.
